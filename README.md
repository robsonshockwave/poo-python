## Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

Object-oriented programming is based on the following principles:

- **Encapsulation**
- **Abstraction**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**

Also, other concepts, such as:
- **Abstract classes**
- **Composition**
- **Aggregation**
- **Interfaces**
- **MVC (model-view-controller)**
